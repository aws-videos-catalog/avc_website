* Application styles entrypoint.

  It is strongly encouraged to write styles with BEM methodology in mind.
  The reason is to provide a single style of writing CSS that is popular
  among developers and plays very well with components splitting in Vue.js applications.

  Please, note that Boostrap CSS framework is used in the project and should be considered
  a go-to solution when approaching tasks.
  Custom styling should be done inside components and revolve around the component itself.
  There should be very few cases when child/parent components are accessed.

  It is highly recommended to avoid usage of "scoped" attribute of Vue.js component's style tag.
  Main reasons for such decision:
  - Scoped styles are often used as an escape solution to avoid solving
  the problem of conflicting styles;
  - Scoped styles eventually downgrade CSS performance due to the nature of attribute selectors;
