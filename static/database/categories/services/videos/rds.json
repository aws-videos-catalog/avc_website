Whether you have a new serverless cloud application, a database that is using Amazon RDS, or a high-transaction application using SAP HANA over hybrid cloud architecture, these databases need to be backed up, protected, and quickly recovered. Legacy backup solutions that were built for on-premises environments don’t quite cut it for today’s cloud workloads, while cloud snapshots can quickly become a burden to manage. Learn how to automate the backup of your cloud databases and provide fast and reliable recovery options when needed using Cohesity’s modern data management software.
