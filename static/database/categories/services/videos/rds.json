Amazon RDS automates time-consuming administrative tasks such as database setup, patching, backups, and restore in your on-premises environments. See how Amazon RDS makes it seamless to create, monitor, and manage databases running across your data centers and the cloud.",

Whether you have a new serverless cloud application, a database that is using Amazon RDS, or a high-transaction application using SAP HANA over hybrid cloud architecture, these databases need to be backed up, protected, and quickly recovered. Legacy backup solutions that were built for on-premises environments donâ€™t quite cut it for todayâ€™s cloud workloads, while cloud snapshots can quickly become a burden to manage. Learn how to automate the backup of your cloud databases and provide fast and reliable recovery options when needed using Cohesityâ€™s modern data management software.
