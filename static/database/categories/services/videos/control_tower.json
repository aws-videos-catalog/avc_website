In this session, we show you how Control Tower automates the creation of a secure and compliant landing zone with best-practice blueprints for a multi-account structure, identity and federated access management, a central log archive, cross-account security audits, and workflows for provisioning accounts with pre-approved configurations. We also discuss guardrails—pre-packaged governance rules created for security, operations, and compliance that you can apply enterprise-wide or to groups of accounts to enforce policies or detect violations. Finally, we show you how to easily manage and monitor all this through the Control Tower dashboard.\n\nComplete Title: AWS re:Inforce 2019: Using AWS Control Tower to Govern Multi-Account AWS Environments at Scale (GRC313-R)",
