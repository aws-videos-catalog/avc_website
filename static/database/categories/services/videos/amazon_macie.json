Amazon uses Machine Learning to detect anomalies in AWS account and workload activity with Amazon GuardDuty. Amazon Macie also uses Machine Learning to automatically discover and classify sensitive data. Both of these services are recently released and provide new mechanisms and a new paradigm for customers to protect themselves in the AWS cloud. This talk will cover both services and provide examples of the output of the Machine Learning they use to help customers stay secure at scale on AWS. \n\nSpeaker: \n- Phil Rodrigues, Principal Security Solutions Architect , Amazon Web Services, ANZ",
