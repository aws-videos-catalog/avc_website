The IoT device landscape ranges from highly constrained sensor nodes to industrial gateways with a large amount of processing power. In this session, we discuss the different SDKs, edge computing software, and real-time operating systems you can use to seamlessly connect a wide array of devices to the AWS IoT Core. Learn how easy it is to develop and deploy a program on an ESP32 microcontroller running Amazon FreeRTOS, and leave this session understanding the different ways you can connect your devices to the AWS IoT Core.\n\nSpeaker: Simith Nambiar, Partner Solution Architect - IoT, Amazon Web Services",
