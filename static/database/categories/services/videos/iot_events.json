        "description": "AWS IoT Events is a new IoT-managed service that allows enterprises with large operations dependent on IoT devices to continuously monitor data from their equipment, applications, and fleets of devices for changes in operation and trigger the appropriate response when events occur. IoT Events monitors inputs from many IoT sensors and applications simultaneously; it can also combine sensor and application data with analytical results, including machine learning from AWS IoT Analytics. It helps customers reduce costs through efficiency gains, minimize downtime, and improve product quality. IoT Events is applicable to several industries, including device manufacturers, manufacturing plants, power and utilities, shipping, oil and gas, etc. Join us for this session to learn more about the customer benefits of IoT Events, and catch a demo of IoT Events in action.",
