AWS provides stewardship over the FreeRTOS kernel and makes continuous investments in its functionality and community. Most recently, the FreeRTOS kernel was updated to use an MIT license, extended with MIT-licensed security and connectivity libraries, and contributed support for the open RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).\n\nRichard Elberger dives deep into how additions to the MIT-licensed FreeRTOS ecosystem help MCU device developers overcome the new security and connectivity challenges presented when connecting small microcontrollers to the IoT.",
