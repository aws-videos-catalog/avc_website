Serverless computing means that you can build web, mobile, and IoT backends, run stream processing or big data workloads, run chatbots, and more. In this session, learn how to get started with serverless computing with AWS Lambda, which lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. We introduce you to the basics of building with Lambda. As part of that, we show how you can benefit from features such as continuous scaling, built-in high availability, integrations with AWS and third-party apps, and subsecond metering pricing. We also introduce you to the broader portfolio of AWS services that help you build serverless applications with Lambda, including Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Step Functions, and more.",

You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests.

Creating an application with serverless functions, such as with AWS Lambda, provides agility and scalability to your application, but it also creates an added challenge for code tracing. In this session, we review Datadog's distributed tracing capabilities and how Trek10 uses those capabilities to improve its customers’ applications. Learn how to use AWS X-Ray in a serverless environment. Also, learn strategies for working with traces and logs that explain application errors. Finally, learn how Trek10 uses AWS X-Ray with Datadog to measure and improve its applications' performance. This session is brought to you by AWS partner, Datadog.

Come learn how to build a robust, scalable, and highly available serverless application using AWS Lambda. In this session, we discuss hacks and tricks for maximizing your AWS Lambda performance, such as leveraging customer reuse, using the 500 MB scratch space and local cache, creating custom metrics for managing operations, aligning upstream and downstream services to scale along with Lambda, and many other workarounds and optimizations across your entire function lifecycle. \n\nYou also learn how Hearst converted its real-time clickstream analytics data pipeline from a server-based model to a serverless one. The infrastructure of the data pipeline relied on Amazon EC2 instances and cron jobs to shepherd data through the process. In 2016, Hearst converted its data pipeline architecture to a serverless process that relies on event triggers and the power of AWS Lambda. By moving from a time-based process to a trigger-based process, Hearst improved its pipeline latency times by 50%.",

This session describes reusable serverless patterns while considering costs. For each pattern, we provide operational and security best practices and discuss potential pitfalls and nuances. We also discuss the considerations for moving an existing server-based workload to a serverless architecture. The patterns use services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Kinesis Streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, AWS Step Functions, AWS Config, AWS X-Ray, and Amazon Athena. This session can help you recognize candidates for serverless architectures in your own organizations and understand areas of potential savings and increased agility. What’s new in 2017: using X-Ray in Lambda for tracing and operational insight; a pattern on high performance computing (HPC) using Lambda at scale; how a query can be achieved using Athena; Step Functions as a way to handle orchestration for both the Automation and Batch patterns; a pattern for Security Automation using AWS Config rules to detect and automatically remediate violations of security standards; how to validate API parameters in API Gateway to protect your API back-ends; and a solid focus on CI/CD development pipelines for serverless, which includes testing, deploying, and versioning (SAM tools).",

        "description": "Learn more about This Is My Architecture at - https://amzn.to/2GHqOjR.\nTandem wanted to help their customers make sense of bank account statements. In this episode, they share how they built a data pipeline that ingests data from customer bank statements from third-party banks. They use Amazon Kinesis to store the ingested data, then Amazon Simple Queueing Service and AWS Lambda process the data using ANTLR for NLP parser generation. The processed transaction data is then stored in Amazon Relational Database Service so it can be presented to the customer.\n\nHost: Toby Knight, Manager, Solutions Architecture\nCustomer: Damian Moore, Principal Data Engineer, Tandem\n\nSubscribe: \nMore AWS videos http://bit.ly/2O3zS75 \nMore AWS events videos http://bit.ly/316g9t4\n\n#AWS",

        "description": "To get the most out of the agility afforded by serverless and containers, it is essential to build CI/CD pipelines that help teams iterate on code and quickly release features. In this talk, we demonstrate how developers can build effective CI/CD release workflows to manage their serverless or containerized deployments on AWS. We cover infrastructure-as-code (IaC) application models, such as AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and new imperative IaC tools. We also demonstrate how to set up CI/CD release pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, and we show you how to automate safer deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.",

        "description": "AWS Lambda empowers developers to build cloud-native web applications or platforms using microservices architecture. The three-tier web app has been a cornerstone architecture pattern for decades in this space. This session walks you through the process of identifying the presentation, logic, and data tiers required to build web applications with AWS Lambda at the core. By using AWS Lambda as your logic tier, you have a wide number of data storage options for your data tier. AWS offers a wide range of database services to fit your application requirements. We dive into methodologies for picking the right database technology based on your application requirements.\n\nYou learn the benefits of SQL vs. NoSQL database architectures for the data tier of your serverless app. We demonstrate connecting your serverless app to various AWS database offerings including Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon ElastiCache, and elaborate on the setup of each option with AWS Lambda. We also provide guidelines and best practices for implementing this architecture pattern, such as setting up a VPC on Lambda to connect to private resources, leveraging local caching for opportunistic performance improvement, choosing the right language runtime for different workload patterns, managing database connections, and more.",

In this pattern, you configure S3 to notify Lambda when events happen, to run your custom code. This video shows how this works in detail, reviewing the characteristics of both services, and how to use the integration for building highly scalable applications.\n\nThis is the first video in a series showing specific examples of how you can use this pattern to provide useful functionality in your business applications. Learn how you can do things like automated language translation, workflow management, and bringing sentiment analysis to audio recordings. \n\nLearn more about AWS S3-to-Lambda serverless at https://go.aws/3aVywUx\n\nSubscribe: \nMore AWS videos http://bit.ly/2O3zS75 \nMore AWS events videos http://bit.ly/316g9t4\n\n#AWS #AWSDemo",
