We introduce you to the basics of building with Lambda. As part of that, we show how you can benefit from features such as continuous scaling, built-in high availability, integrations with AWS and third-party apps, and subsecond metering pricing. We also introduce you to the broader portfolio of AWS services that help you build serverless applications with Lambda, including Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Step Functions, and more.",

AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests. With Amazon Lambda you pay only for the requests served and the compute time required to run your code, making it cost-effective and easy to scale automatically from a few requests per day to thousands per second.",

In this presentation, you’ll find out how to quickly declare an API interface and connect it with code running on AWS Lambda.  Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.  We will demonstrate how to build an API that uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authorization and Amazon Cognito to retrieve temporary credentials for your API calls. We will write the AWS Lambda function code in Java and build an iOS sample application in Objective C.\n\nLearn more: http://amzn.to/2iNiAul",

What’s new in 2017: using X-Ray in Lambda for tracing and operational insight; a pattern on high performance computing (HPC) using Lambda at scale; how a query can be achieved using Athena; Step Functions as a way to handle orchestration for both the Automation and Batch patterns; a pattern for Security Automation using AWS Config rules to detect and automatically remediate violations of security standards; how to validate API parameters in API Gateway to protect your API back-ends; and a solid focus on CI/CD development pipelines for serverless, which includes testing, deploying, and versioning (SAM tools).",

This session shows how Revvel migrated from transcoding video on EC2 instances to a serverless pipeline using AWS Lambda and Amazon S3. You will gain insights on how they were able to achieve massive parallelization that gives Revvel the ability to transcode an entire movie or TV series into multiple device formats and bitrates within minutes, while never paying for idle resources. In addition, the Revvel team will cover best practices and lessons learned in creating a custom CI/CD pipeline for Lambda functions that allows them to test code quality during an upgrade to a Lambda function. Revvel is a team within Verizon, chartered with building and innovating video solutions. In November 2016, Verizon acquired Vessel to accelerate their efforts in building a next-generation television service, and Revvel was born.",

        "title": "The S3-to-Lambda Serverless Design Pattern",
        "description": "The S3-to-Lambda serverless design pattern can become a flexible core for your serverless applications. In this pattern, you configure S3 to notify Lambda when events happen, to run your custom code. This video shows how this works in detail, reviewing the characteristics of both services, and how to use the integration for building highly scalable applications.\n\nThis is the first video in a series showing specific examples of how you can use this pattern to provide useful functionality in your business applications. Learn how you can do things like automated language translation, workflow management, and bringing sentiment analysis to audio recordings. \n\nLearn more about AWS S3-to-Lambda serverless at https://go.aws/3aVywUx\n\nSubscribe: \nMore AWS videos http://bit.ly/2O3zS75 \nMore AWS events videos http://bit.ly/316g9t4\n\n#AWS #AWSDemo",
