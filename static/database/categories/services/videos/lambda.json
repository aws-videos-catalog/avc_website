This offloads all the bandwidth and compute requirements away from your application, and instead relies on the massive scalability of S3. \n\nThis walkthrough shows how to implement an uploading solution for a broader application. You can use this method in any type of web application, even ones that are not serverless.  It’s a simple example you can easily extend for your own needs. All the code is available in a GitHub repo.\n\nThis series is about the S3-to-Lambda serverless design pattern, and how it can become a flexible core for your serverless applications.

You can trigger Step Functions workflows from S3 events, enabling you to build scalable state machine easily. This design can be used for all sorts of practical business use-cases. For example, saving a signed customer contract from an email into a S3 bucket could start a work-order process.\n\nIn this example, I create a workflow that’s triggered by photos stored in an S3 bucket. If the photo is a picture of a cat, it causes one Lambda function to run. If it’s a dog, it triggers another Lambda function.  It’s a simple example you can easily extend for your own needs. All the code is available in a GitHub repo.\n\nThis series is about the S3-to-Lambda serverless design pattern, and how it can become a flexible core for your serverless applications.

Serverless applications don't require you to provision, scale, and manage any servers. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.\n\nFor more information on Amazon SageMaker, visit https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.",

Step Functions can help developers greatly reduce the code they need to maintain by providing a standardized way to handle failures, retries, parallelization, and basic decision tree logic. As of AWS re:Invent 2018 you can also create workflows without any custom code, leveraging new capabilities of Step Functions to interface directly with AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, and Glue. In this session join expert guest Chris Munns, Principal Developer Advocate of Serverless Applications, and walk through the capabilities of Step Functions and how it can help simplify and improve your application development.\n\nLearn more about AWS on Twitch: https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/twitch/\n\nSee past Twitch.tv/aws Videos: https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/twitch/recordings",

We present a set of approaches for integrating automated security testing and security-centric release control into a CI/CD pipeline and feedback loop without appreciably impacting the loop’s cycle rate in this context, and adding automated penetration testing as a further feedback stage for potential Continuous Deployment. Further, automation can be used to react to, and in some cases automatically remediate, classes of security events; we discuss the use of CloudWatch Events as a Lambda trigger for addressing threat intelligence information via GuardDuty, as well as being a trigger for rapidly assessing and acting on API call events. CloudWatch Events can also function as \"cron for Lambda\", and we present an example where it is used in this manner to fetch reputation lists from realtime blackhole lists and synthesize them into AWS WAF rules.",

You can use Amazon Kinesis and Amazon SQS to create a universal event stream to orchestrate Lambdas into much more complex applications. Now, using AWS Step Functions, we can build large distributed applications with Lambdas using visual workflows. See how Step Functions are different from Amazon SWF, how to get started with Step Functions, and how to use them to take your Lambda-based applications to the next level. We start with a few granular functions and stitch them up using Step Functions. As we build out the application, we add monitoring to ensure that changes we make actually improve things, not make them worse. Leave the session with actionable learnings for using Step Functions in your environment right away.\n\n\n\nSession sponsored by Datadog",

In the past, you had to provision and scale servers to run your application code, install and operate distributed databases, and build and run custom software to handle API requests. Now, AWS provides a stack of scalable, fully-managed services that eliminates these operational complexities. In this session, you will learn about serverless architectures, their benefits, and the basics of the AWS’s serverless stack (e.g., AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Step Functions).\n\nWe will discuss how to use serverless architectures for a variety of use cases including data processing, website backends, serverless applications, and “operational glue.” You will also get practical tips and tricks, best practices, and architecture patterns that you can take back and implement immediately.",

Just for starters, the bounds of their functionality, how they communicate with their dependencies, and how they provide an interface for their own consumers. Serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda change paradigms around code structure, usage of libraries, and how you deploy and manage your applications. In this session, we show you how by combining microservices and serverless technologies, you can achieve the ultimate flexibility and agility that microservices aim for, while providing business value in how serverless greatly reduces operational overhead and cost.\n\nIn addition, National Geographic will share how it built its NG1 platform using a serverless, microservices architecture. The NG1 platform provides National Geographic consumers with content personalized to their preferences and behaviors in an intuitive, easy-to-use way on smartphones.",

This session walks you through the process of identifying the presentation, logic, and data tiers required to build web applications with AWS Lambda at the core. By using AWS Lambda as your logic tier, you have a wide number of data storage options for your data tier. AWS offers a wide range of database services to fit your application requirements. We dive into methodologies for picking the right database technology based on your application requirements.\n\nYou learn the benefits of SQL vs. NoSQL database architectures for the data tier of your serverless app. We demonstrate connecting your serverless app to various AWS database offerings including Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon ElastiCache, and elaborate on the setup of each option with AWS Lambda. We also provide guidelines and best practices for implementing this architecture pattern, such as setting up a VPC on Lambda to connect to private resources, leveraging local caching for opportunistic performance improvement, choosing the right language runtime for different workload patterns, managing database connections, and more.",
