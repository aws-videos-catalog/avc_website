When building a fraud detection system, start by preparing the data, and work with small chunks of data and run parallel jobs so your machine learning (ML) models can predict fraudulent activity. For that, you schedule computer resources and, of course, the script. With AWS Batch, you only worry about your application job and run it at scale. With containers, you think in small processes and let AWS Batch run them concurrently. In this session, learn to build a fraud detection system and integrate it with other AWS services. \n\nThis session is part of re:Invent Developer Community Day, a series led by AWS enthusiasts who share first-hand, technical insights on trending topics.",

Amazon ECS makes it easy to run and manage Docker-enabled applications across a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. In this session will show you how to run batch jobs using Amazon ECS and together with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon SQS. We will see how you can leverage Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to power your ECS cluster and easily scale your batch workloads. You'll hear from Mapbox on how they use ECS to power their entire batch processing architecture to collect and process over 100 million miles of sensor data per day that they use for powering their maps.  Mapbox will also discuss how they optimize their batch processing framework on ECS using Spot Instances and demo their open source framework that will help you get up and running with ECS in minutes.",
