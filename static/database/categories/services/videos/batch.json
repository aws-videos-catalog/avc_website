        "description": "AWS Batch is a fully-managed service that enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run batch computing workloads of any scale on AWS. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, allowing you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch plans, schedules, and executes your batch computing workloads across the full range of AWS compute services and features, such as Amazon EC2, Spot Instances, and AWS Lambda. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saving time and reducing costs. In this session, Principal Product Managers Jamie Kinney and Dougal Ballantyne describe the core concepts behind AWS Batch and details of how the service functions.Â  The presentation concludes with relevant use cases and sample code.",
