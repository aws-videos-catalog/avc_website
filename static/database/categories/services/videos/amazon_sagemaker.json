DigitalGlobe went all-in on AWS to meet the growing demand for commercial geo-intelligence, migrating its entire 18-year imagery archive to the cloud.  With the new WorldView Legion satellite constellation coming online, DigitalGlobe looked to leverage AWS for migrating their GBDX machine learning software to autonomously analyze incoming data at scale. GBDX leverages Amazon SageMaker to drastically speed-up both inferencing & training of machine learning models, ushering in a new era of rapid feedback & iteration: a data scientist’s dream come true.​\n\nSpeakers: Nate Ricklin, Kate Werling",

These include fine-grained access control, end-to-end encryption in transit, encryption at rest with AWS KMS customer-managed customer master keys (CMKs), private connectivity to all Amazon SageMaker APIs, and comprehensive audit trails for resource and data access.\n\nComplete Title: AWS re:Inforce 2019: Securing Your Amazon SageMaker Model Development in a Highly Regulated Environment (SDD315) \n\n Presenter(s): \n-  Hung Pham, Vanguard\n-  Ritesh Shah, Vanguard",

With machine learning you can interpret data automatically, generating precise measurements in near real-time without the need for core data. Access to enhanced datasets like these allow you to more quickly and effectively conduct formation evaluation, drilling, geo-steering, and many other workflows.

The company sought to reduce its networking on outbound bid requests sent to advertising partners, so they developed a traffic filtering service that uses machine learning with Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EMR to predict advertising partners’ likelihood to bid in auctions. “We used to pay very high amount of money in outbound traffic for our bid requests,” says François Guerraz, systems architect at Smaato. “Thanks to machine learning, we’ve been able to predict effectively which demand partners are going to be interested in specific ad requests, and only send the request to a specific subset of the demand partners. We have achieved a 75% cost reduction in outbound network costs.”\n\nWatch this re:Invent session to learn more about how Smaato uses Amazon SageMaker at http://bit.ly/32sNSxa\n\nSubscribe:\nMore AWS videos http://bit.ly/2O3zS75\nMore AWS events videos http://bit.ly/316g9t4 \n\n#AWS #AWSCustomer",

Join us as we introduce the new Amazon SageMaker notebooks experience, which allows you to access notebooks in seconds without spinning up compute instances. The elastic notebooks allow you to easily scale compute up or down, and the changes take place automatically without interrupting your work. You can share notebooks by automatically reproducing the environment and library dependencies without manually tracking them so others can reproduce the results with the same data. With this new experience, you can build models faster and collaborate at scale.",

In addition, data scientists needed to design and build end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipelines to orchestrate complex ML workflows for deploying ML models in production. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists can now focus on creating the best possible models while enabling organizations to easily build and automate end-to-end ML pipelines. In this session, we dive deep into Amazon SageMaker and container technologies, and we discuss how easy it is to integrate such tasks as model training and deployment into Kubernetes and Kubeflow-based ML pipelines.",
