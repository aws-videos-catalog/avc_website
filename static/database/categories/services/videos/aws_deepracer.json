In 2018, AWS released several new services that make it much simpler for data science and development teams alike to start exploring and applying RL. Join this session to understand how, with some basic python knowledge, you can get started with writing a reward function that teaches a small RC car to navigate its way around a race track autonomously. For those who want to apply RL to their own use cases, we dive into the features of Amazon SageMaker RL.\n\nSpeaker: James Ousby, Senior Solutions Architect, AWS, ANZ",
