        "description": "Many machine learning (ML) applications require humans to review for labeling or moderation of nuanced content, which can result in low confidence predictions to ensure the correct results. But building human review systems can be time-consuming and expensive. Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) makes it easy to build and manage human reviews for ML applications through built-in workflows for common ML use cases, such as content moderation (with Amazon Rekognition) and text extraction (with Amazon Textract). You can create workflows for custom ML models or those built on Amazon SageMaker. In this session, learn about Amazon A2I and how to use it. Then hear from Ripcord about how they plan to use Amazon A2I built-in integration with Amazon Textract to reduce the initial set up time for large and complex digitization projects.",
