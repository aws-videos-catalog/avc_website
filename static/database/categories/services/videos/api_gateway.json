        "description": "API Gateways can simplify the work that a developer needs to do to build API based services by helping to standardize authentication and authorization, consumer interfaces, and management needs. With Amazon API Gateway you get all of this and more, including a completely serverless management of your APIs and the ability to host them at almost any scale. You also can get the benefits of the numerous types of APIs that are supported, from pubic to private, REST to Websockets, backed by almost any backend you can think of. Come and join expert guest Chris Munns, Principal Developer Advocate of Serverless Applications, and review the powerful capabilities of Amazon API Gateway and how you can get started building awesome APIs.\n\nLearn more about AWS on Twitch: https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/twitch/\n\nSee past Twitch.tv/aws Videos: https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/twitch/recordings",

Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.  We will demonstrate how to build an API that uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authorization and Amazon Cognito to retrieve temporary credentials for your API calls.

        "description": "APIs have become the norm for allowing applications to communicate with each other. On AWS, customers turn to Amazon API Gateway to build HTTP, REST, or WebSocket APIs, providing communication endpoints between services and clients. However, API Gateway can do much more. In this session, we demo setting up a REST API using API Gateway. We walk though configuring a simple Lambda-based backend and adding on capabilities around data modeling and validation, custom responses, and functionless integration with backend services. Learn about some of the advanced functionality that can be done at the API level before it ever hits your backend service.",
