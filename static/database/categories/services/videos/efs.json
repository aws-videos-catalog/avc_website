Amazon EFS Infrequent Access is a cost-optimized storage class for files not accessed every day, reducing storage costs by up to 85% compared to the Amazon EFS Standard storage class. Along with EFS IA, we will introduce EFS Lifecycle Management, which automatically transitions infrequently accessed files into the new storage class. Come learn how Amazon EFS Infrequent Access will work and how to get started.

We found using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) gave us the flexibility and performance we were seeking while saving us significant time, effort, and cost. In this session, we discuss how Monsanto uses the Amazon EFS service to run our large scaling geospatial data sets such as raster, and to perform highly parallelized analytics for data scientists and business users.

JIRA Data Center's requirement to use a shared file system caused us to try several in-house and third-party solutions prior to the availability of Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). We chose EFS for its performance, ease of use, automatic scaling, and out-of-the-box distribution capabilities. In this session, we discuss how Atlassian uses EFS to run JIRA Data Center.
