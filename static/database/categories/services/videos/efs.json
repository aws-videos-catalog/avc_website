In this session, we discuss how Monsanto uses the Amazon EFS service to run our large scaling geospatial data sets such as raster, and to perform highly parallelized analytics for data scientists and business users.

JIRA Data Center's requirement to use a shared file system caused us to try several in-house and third-party solutions prior to the availability of Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). We chose EFS for its performance, ease of use, automatic scaling, and out-of-the-box distribution capabilities. In this session, we discuss how Atlassian uses EFS to run JIRA Data Center.

We’ll also explore how AWS IAM Authorization and EFS Access Points can simplify configuring more granular access to our data for different scenarios. \n\nAmazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a simple, scalable, and fully-managed shared file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. Whether you’re developing a new containerized application or modernizing an existing monolith, there are many types of applications where a shared persistence layer is an essential ingredient in achieving a resilient and durable architecture.\n\nLearn more about AWS Storage at - https://go.aws/3e7MdSF\n\nPersistent File Storage for Modern Applications: https://go.aws/2LKgsmd\nGitHub sample code repository: https://bit.ly/2TlBewC\nTutorial on using Amazon EFS File Systems with Amazon ECS: https://amzn.to/3g5FPNr\nAWS News Blog launch announcement: https://go.aws/3bLWLoP\nDevelopers guide to using Amazon EFS with Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate: https://go.aws/3e53pZ0\n\n\nSubscribe: \nMore AWS videos http://bit.ly/2O3zS75 \nMore AWS events videos http://bit.ly/316g9t4\n\n#AWS #AmazonEFS",
