If your answer is “yes,” this session is for you. Join us as we cover the different types of policies and describe how they work together to control access to resources in your account and across your AWS organization. We walk through use cases that help you delegate permission management to developers by demonstrating IAM permission boundaries. We take an in-depth look at controlling access to specific AWS regions using condition keys. Finally, we explain how to use tags to scale permissions management in your account. This session requires you to know the basics of IAM policies.",
