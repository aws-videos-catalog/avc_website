In this session, we detail how event-driven architectures improve application scalability and reliability and why they are important in both serverless and traditional compute models. We cover the architectural patterns and best practices for successfully building event-driven systems in the context of real-world use cases, and we discuss the AWS services that support events, including Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS. Expect to leave with a deeper understanding of how to introduce and optimize an event-based architecture in your application.",

EventBridge makes building event-driven application easy because it takes care of event ingestion and delivery, security, authorization, and error-handling for you. It also automatically routes events from their source to one or more targets such as AWS Lambda functions and Amazon Kinesis streams We see our customers building event-driven applications more and more because they increase the speed at which teams can build applications.
