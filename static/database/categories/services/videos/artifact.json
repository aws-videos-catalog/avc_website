The cloud is a perfect environment for handling problems of this scale; however, there are many unanswered questions around best practices and suitable architectures for dealing with massive, high-quality assets. In this session, we will define problem cases and discuss practical architectural patterns for dealing with these challenges by using AWS services such as Amazon EC2 (graphical instances), Amazon EMR, Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, Amazon Glacier, AWS Snowball, and the new magnetic EBS volumes. The best practices that we'll discuss will also be helpful to architects and engineers who are dealing with non-video data. Amazon Studios will present how, powered by AWS, they solved many of these problems and are able to create, manage, and distribute Emmy Award-winning content.",
