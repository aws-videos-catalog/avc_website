Visit the APN Technical Baseline Review page: https://amzn.to/2Y7ImfS\nThis episode covers the AWS Support requirement of the Technical Baseline Review (‘baseline’) and the benefits AWS Business Support offers to AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners and customers.\n\nThe baseline requires AWS Business Support or greater to be enabled on all production AWS accounts. These include accounts that are operated as part of a managed service, accounts that are essential to the proper functioning of a SaaS or other 'as-a-service' offerings, accounts from which customer-facing collateral are distributed (e.g. sharing AMIs), and accounts that contain customer data. \n\nThe baseline is a review of an APN Partner’s solution against a set of best practices that are most critical for partner and customer success. Passing the baseline is required to qualify APN Technology Partners for APN Advanced Tier.\n\nFor more information about AWS Business Support and it’s benefits, please visit: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\n\nLearn more about the baseline!
