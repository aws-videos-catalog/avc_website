However, many analysts are unprepared for the challenges of setting up a big data analytical environment. In this talk, we outline a process that allows anyone in an organization to quickly spin up elastic Spark clusters, then analyze data through RStudio and SparkR, or alternatively pySpark and Jupyter Notebooks. The resulting system is affordable, powerful, and incredibly accessible: It takes just two clicks and a 15-minute wait time for analysts to each have their own cluster. This session will cover the following: the Amazon EMR bootstrap process for installations of high-level languages to work on top of Spark (specifically SparkR and pySpark); dynamic port forwarding with SSH and Foxy Proxy for browser access to RStudio and Jupyter; convenient data loading from Amazon S3 to EMR without leaving RStudio or Jupyter; and automating the startup process for nontechnical data analysts and researchers. Finally, we will share some short studies that demonstrate the power of Spark with EMR to interactively analyze massive datasets and discern public policy insights.",

Netflix is a heavy user of AWS for much of its ongoing operations, and  Data Science & Engineering (DSE) is no exception. In this talk, we dive into the Netflix DSE architecture: what and why. Key topics include their use of  Big Data technologies (Cassandra, Hadoop, Pig + Python, and Hive); their Amazon S3 central data hub; their multiple persistent Amazon EMR clusters; how they benefit from AWS elasticity; their data science-as-a-service approach, how they made a hybrid AWS/data center setup work well, their open-source  Hadoop-related software, and more.",

By leveraging Spark ML, a set of machine learning algorithms included with Spark, customers can quickly build and execute massively parallel machine learning jobs. Additionally, Spark applications can train models in streaming or batch contexts, and can access data from Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Redshift, and other services. This session explains how to quickly and easily create scalable Spark clusters with Amazon EMR, build and share models using Apache Zeppelin and Jupyter notebooks, and use the Spark ML pipelines API to manage your training workflow. In addition, Jasjeet Thind, Senior Director of Data Science and Engineering at Zillow Group, will discuss his organization's development of personalization algorithms and platforms at scale using Spark on Amazon EMR.",

Developers can search, sort, filter, and combine interesting profiles; during a site slowdown or page failure, this allows a fast diagnosis and speedy recovery. Some of our analyses run nightly, while others run in real-time via Storm topologies. This session includes our use cases for code profiling, its benefits, and the implementation of its handlers and analysis flows.

        "description": "Organizations need to perform increasingly complex analysis on their data â€” streaming analytics, ad-hoc querying and predictive analytics â€” in order to get better customer insights and actionable business intelligence. However, the growing data volume, speed, and complexity of diverse data formats make current tools inadequate or difficult to use. Apache Spark has recently emerged as the framework of choice to address these challenges. Spark is a general-purpose processing framework that follows a DAG model and also provides high-level APIs, making it more flexible and easier to use than MapReduce. Thanks to its use of in-memory datasets (RDDs), embedded libraries, fault-tolerance, and support for a variety of programming languages, Apache Spark enables developers to implement and scale far more complex big data use cases, including real-time data processing, interactive querying, graph computations and predictive analytics. In this session, we present a technical deep dive on Spark running on Amazon EMR. You learn why Spark is great for ad-hoc interactive analysis and real-time stream processing, how to deploy and tune scalable clusters running Spark on Amazon EMR, how to use EMRFS with Spark to query data directly in Amazon S3, and best practices and patterns for Spark on Amazon EMR.",
