We'll also walk through how you can configure multiple origin servers for your Amazon CloudFront distribution providing you the flexibility to keep your content in different origin locations without the need to create multiple distributions or manage multiple domain names on your website.. We also show you how you can use query string parameters to help customize your web pages for each viewer and how you can configure multiple cache behaviors for your download distribution based on URL patterns on your website.
