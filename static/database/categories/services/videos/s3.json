Learn more at - http://amzn.to/2BUlCVV.  By reducing the volume of data that has to be loaded and processed by your analytics applications, S3 Select can improve the performance of most applications that frequently access data from S3 by up to 400%. \n\nAmazon Glacier Select: Amazon Glacier Select is a new way to query archived data in Amazon Glacier. Amazon Glacier Select allows queries to run directly on data stored in Amazon Glacier, retrieving only the data you need out of your archives to use for analytics. This allows you to reduce total cost of ownership while massively extending your data lake into cost-effective archive storage.

        "description": "Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL, and Athena now supports querying encrypted data stored in S3. Learn more about Amazon Athena here - http://amzn.to/2noO6kp\n\nProtecting sensitive information – such as security logs, financial transactions, healthcare records, and more – is often done by encrypting data. However, in many cases, users need to decide between securing their data or making it available for analytics. One of the big advantages of AWS is that you don’t have to make tough choices with your data. Amazon Redshift and Amazon EMR have long supported analytics on encrypted data. We’re excited to bring this capability to Athena. Now, you can easily run SQL queries directly against your encrypted data in S3 and write encrypted results back to your S3 bucket. Both, server-side encryption and client-side encryption are supported, enabling you to query your data while it’s protected at rest, encrypted in Amazon S3; and in-transit, as it travels to and from Amazon S3; and also via Athena’s JDBC driver, over encrypted communication channels.\n\nWhen you run a query, Athena infers the encryption information from your data automatically. Then it processes the data and encrypts the results with a user specific key before writing them to S3 and sending them back to the console. This means your data is secure at every step of the process. Athena also integrates with the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.\n\nYou can query data that’s encrypted using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys, Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Keys, and Client-Side Encryption with keys managed by the AWS Key Management Service.",

You can run Amazon Redshift queries on Amazon S3 data on its own, or you can run queries that join together data in S3 with data already in your Redshift data warehouse. We will highlight technical details of query execution and implementation of Redshift Spectrum. We will show a live demonstration, running a query over 1 exabyte of data. We will talk about supported queries, data formats, and strategies to save cost by compressing or transforming your data into a columnar format.",

But when done correctly, data lakes can be valuable wells of knowledge that transform your business. Join Etleap and the Amazon Redshift team as we take a deep dive into the issues that plague data lake creators. We give you five refreshing pointers for keeping the development workload sustainable and ensuring data usability for the long term. This presentation is brought to you by Etleap, an APN Partner.",

As we ingest, transform, transport, and visualize data, we find this data naturally weaving in and out of S3. Amazon S3 provides us the flexibility to use an interoperable set of big data processing tools like Spark, Presto, Hive, and Pig. It serves as the hub for transporting data to additional data stores / engines like Teradata, Redshift, and Druid, as well as exporting data to reporting tools like Microstrategy and Tableau. Over time, we have built an ecosystem of services and tools to manage our data on S3. We have a federated metadata catalog service that keeps track of all our data. We have a set of data lifecycle management tools that expire data based on business rules and compliance. We also have a portal that allows users to see the cost and size of their data footprint. In this talk, we’ll dive into these major uses of S3, as well as many smaller cases, where S3 smoothly addresses an important data infrastructure need. We will also provide solutions and methodologies on how you can build your own S3 big data hub.",

Amazon S3 is a powerful building block that can enable you to focus your time on the value and functionality of your application, rather than the challenges of scaling it. In this session we'll cover techniques to best take advantage of the platform. We'll discuss structuring your key naming convention to maximize consistency of performance, as well as ways to optimize your upload and download throughput. We'll learn how to eliminate proxies between your application and Amazon S3, and use the platform for your logging needs. Finally, we'll cover simple techniques for efficiently managing the billions of objects your highly scaled application may accumulate.",

        "description": "Customers using Amazon S3 at large scale benefit greatly from storage management features. Storage lifecycle policies help them reduce storage costs. Cross-region replication makes it easier to copy data between AWS regions for compliance or disaster recovery. Event notifications allow automatic initiation of processes on objects as they arrive, or capture information about objects and log it for security purposes. In this session, you'll learn about these features, and also several new storage management features in Amazon S3 that give users unmatched visibility into what data they are storing and how that data is being used. These new features make it simpler to analyze usage by users, apps, or organizations, to highlight anomalies, and to optimize business process workflows. They also help identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve performance, and archive infrequently used data. In addition, they can provide insight into who is accessing data stored in S3. As part of this talk, AWS customer Pinterest shows how they have been able to leverage many of the new S3 storage management features to reduce their storage costs significantly by moving a large amount of their data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard – Infrequent Access storage.",

To deal with this workload, FINRA has architected a platform that separates storage from compute to manage capacity for each independently, leading to improved performance and cost effectiveness. You'll also learn how FINRA was able to leverage Hbase on Amazon EMR to achieve significant benefits over running Hbase on a fixed capacity cluster. FINRA was able to implement a system that seamlessly scales in response to data growth and can scale quickly in response to user traffic. By working with multiple clusters, FINRA can now isolate ETL and user query workloads and has achieved rapid, built-in disaster recovery capability by leveraging data storage on S3 to run from multiple AZs and across regions.",

S3TA can speed up long-distance content transfers to and from Amazon S3, particularly for applications with widespread users or applications hosted far away from S3 bucket.\n\nS3TA improves transfer performance by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed Edge Locations and over AWS backbone networks, and by using network protocol optimizations. You can turn on S3TA with a few clicks in the S3 console.",
