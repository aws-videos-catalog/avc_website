As we ingest, transform, transport, and visualize data, we find this data naturally weaving in and out of S3. Amazon S3 provides us the flexibility to use an interoperable set of big data processing tools like Spark, Presto, Hive, and Pig. It serves as the hub for transporting data to additional data stores / engines like Teradata, Redshift, and Druid, as well as exporting data to reporting tools like Microstrategy and Tableau. Over time, we have built an ecosystem of services and tools to manage our data on S3. We have a federated metadata catalog service that keeps track of all our data. We have a set of data lifecycle management tools that expire data based on business rules and compliance. We also have a portal that allows users to see the cost and size of their data footprint. In this talk, we’ll dive into these major uses of S3, as well as many smaller cases, where S3 smoothly addresses an important data infrastructure need. We will also provide solutions and methodologies on how you can build your own S3 big data hub.",

Cross-region replication makes it easier to copy data between AWS regions for compliance or disaster recovery. Event notifications allow automatic initiation of processes on objects as they arrive, or capture information about objects and log it for security purposes. In this session, you'll learn about these features, and also several new storage management features in Amazon S3 that give users unmatched visibility into what data they are storing and how that data is being used. These new features make it simpler to analyze usage by users, apps, or organizations, to highlight anomalies, and to optimize business process workflows. They also help identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve performance, and archive infrequently used data. In addition, they can provide insight into who is accessing data stored in S3. As part of this talk, AWS customer Pinterest shows how they have been able to leverage many of the new S3 storage management features to reduce their storage costs significantly by moving a large amount of their data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard – Infrequent Access storage.",

In this session, you'll hear how FINRA implemented a data lake on S3 to provide a single source for their big data analytics platform. FINRA ingests 75 billion records each day of stock market transactions, with an AWS storage footprint of 20 petabytes across S3 and Amazon Glacier. To deal with this workload, FINRA has architected a platform that separates storage from compute to manage capacity for each independently, leading to improved performance and cost effectiveness. You'll also learn how FINRA was able to leverage Hbase on Amazon EMR to achieve significant benefits over running Hbase on a fixed capacity cluster. FINRA was able to implement a system that seamlessly scales in response to data growth and can scale quickly in response to user traffic. By working with multiple clusters, FINRA can now isolate ETL and user query workloads and has achieved rapid, built-in disaster recovery capability by leveraging data storage on S3 to run from multiple AZs and across regions.",
